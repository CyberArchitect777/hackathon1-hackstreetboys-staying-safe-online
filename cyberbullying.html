                                <p>One of the most telling signs of cyberbullying is a noticeable and sudden reluctance
                                    to use digital devices. Typically, individuals who are enthusiastic about their
                                    smartphones, tablets, or computers will abruptly show a disinterest or hesitation to
                                    engage with these devices. This shift in behavior can be quite alarming. They might
                                    avoid using their devices altogether, or if they do use them, it's with a sense of
                                    apprehension and discomfort. This change often stems from the fear and anxiety
                                    caused by the harassment they're experiencing online. It's as if the devices, once
                                    sources of entertainment and connection, have become sources of distress and dread.
                                    Recognizing this behavior is crucial because it signals that the individual is
                                    likely facing significant and harmful interactions in their digital spaces. Parents,
                                    guardians, and peers should be attentive to such changes, as they can be a clear
                                    indication that the person is being targeted by cyberbullies, making it imperative
                                    to address the situation promptly and supportively.</p>

                                <h5>Choose kindness</h5>
                            </strong>
                            <p>Use social media for good, by sharing positive and supportive content and messages with
                                your friends, family and colleagues.
                                <br>For example, you could reach out to let someone know you're thinking of them or add
                                a positive comment on a post they shared.</p>

                            <p>If you find yourself responding to a message or post with something negative,
                                pause and consider whether you could frame it in another way or have an in-person
                                conversation instead.
                                If you see or receive messages or content you consider to be bullying or abusive, you
                                should block and report it.</p>

                            <p>Words matter and it's important to think carefully about what we share. We all have the
                                power to be kind and make someone's day!</p>

                                <h5>Stay present and connected IRL</h5>
                            </strong>
                            <p>The lines between the online and offline worlds can feel increasingly blurred, making it
                                hard to live in the present moment and satisfy our innate need for human contact.</p>
                            <p>Do you ever find yourself interrupting what you are doing so you can post it on social
                                media, or scrolling through your friend's stories rather than calling or meeting up to
                                see how they are doing? <br>It's important to try and switch off and take a break from
                                social media every now and then and spend time with friends and family in real life too,
                                where it's safe to do so.</p>

                            <p>Try and set yourself realistic and personal goals, for example not picking up your phone
                                or going online for the first hour of the day (it wastes energy and trains you to absorb
                                information unfiltered) or just before bed.</p>
                            <p>Activities such as meditation, going for a walk, or calling a friend will help provide a
                                similar stimulation but leave you feeling more focused and relaxed.</p>
