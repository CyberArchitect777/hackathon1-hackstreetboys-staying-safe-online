                                <p>One of the most telling signs of cyberbullying is a noticeable and sudden reluctance
                                    to use digital devices. Typically, individuals who are enthusiastic about their
                                    smartphones, tablets, or computers will abruptly show a disinterest or hesitation to
                                    engage with these devices. This shift in behavior can be quite alarming. They might
                                    avoid using their devices altogether, or if they do use them, it's with a sense of
                                    apprehension and discomfort. This change often stems from the fear and anxiety
                                    caused by the harassment they're experiencing online. It's as if the devices, once

                                    sources of entertainment and connection, have become sources of distress and dread.
                                    Recognizing this behavior is crucial because it signals that the individual is
                                    likely facing significant and harmful interactions in their digital spaces. Parents,
                                    guardians, and peers should be attentive to such changes, as they can be a clear
                                    indication that the person is being targeted by cyberbullies, making it imperative
                                    to address the situation promptly and supportively.</p>

                                    themselves from further harassment by withdrawing from social media altogether. This
                                    withdrawal can be abrupt and complete, where they suddenly deactivate or delete
                                    their social media profiles on platforms like Facebook or Instagram. Such a

                                    as a space for socializing, sharing, and expressing themselves, becomes a source of
                                    anxiety and distress, leading them to sever their connections entirely. It's crucial
                                    for parents, guardians, and even close friends to be vigilant and aware of all the
                                    social media accounts their loved ones maintain. This awareness is important
                                    because, in many cases, bullied individuals might not openly communicate their
                                    struggles, leaving their sudden disappearance from online spaces as one of the few
                                    indicators that something is seriously wrong.

                                <p>A person experiencing cyberbullying might exhibit a noticeable reluctance to leave
                                    the safety and comfort of their home. The home, which feels like a sanctuary,
                                    becomes a shield against the outside world's perceived threats. This behavior often
                                    extends to avoiding interactions with peers, including friends, classmates, or
                                    colleagues, as the fear of encountering further harassment or judgment can be
                                    overwhelming. Social situations that were once enjoyable might now seem daunting,
                                    causing the individual to withdraw from social engagements and activities they

                                    previously found pleasure in. This shift can be especially concerning when it
                                    involves hobbies, sports, or other interests that used to bring joy and fulfillment.
                                    The fear and anxiety stemming from online bullying can create a pervasive sense of
                                    insecurity, making the person hesitant to participate in any activity that requires
                                    stepping outside their perceived zone of safety. Recognizing these changes is
                                    crucial, as they can be subtle yet significant indicators of the deep emotional

                                    This reluctance to engage in conversation, particularly regarding topics related to
                                    social media, often stems from apprehension about potential judgments from others.

                            <br>For example, you could reach out to let someone know you're thinking of them or add a
                            positive comment on a post they shared.</p>
                        <p>If you find yourself responding to a message or post with something negative,
                            pause and consider whether you could frame it in another way or have an in-person
                            conversation instead.

                            or scrolling through your friend's stories rather than calling or meeting up to see how they

                            now and then and spend time with friends and family in real life too, where it's safe to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>Try and set yourself realistic and personal goals, for example not picking up your phone or
                            going online for the first hour of the day (it wastes energy and trains you to absorb
                            information unfiltered) or just before bed.</p>
                        <p>Activities such as meditation, going for a walk, or calling a friend will help provide a
                            similar stimulation but leave you feeling more focused and relaxed.</p>
