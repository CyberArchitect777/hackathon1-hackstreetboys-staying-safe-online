                    <p>Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that takes place online. It can include mean text messages,
                        hurtful social media posts, or even spreading rumors through email. Harassment, on the other
                        hand, is a more serious and persistent form of bullying that can have legal consequences.</p>
                    <p>Both cyberbullying and harassment can have a significant impact on a person's mental health. It's
                        important to understand the signs of cyberbullying and harassment, and to take steps to protect
                        yourself online.</p>

                                <h5>Decrease in Device Usage</h5> -
                            </strong> One of the biggest indicators of cyberbullying is an unexpected hesitation to use
                            their devices. If a person suddenly seems disinterested in a device, it's a sign that
                            they're being attacked. </li>

                                <h5>Sudden Withdrawal from Social Media</h5> -
                            </strong> Sometimes, bullied individuals withdraw from social media entirely. They may
                            suddenly delete Facebook or Instagram profiles. Parents should be aware of
                            <strong>all</strong> of their children's accounts.</li>

                            </strong> A person might be reluctant to leave the safety of their home. Also, they may
                            avoid interactions with their peers. Or they may no longer show interest in activities they
                            usually enjoy.</li>

                            </strong> Frustration and sadness can often indicate an online attack. That's especially
                            true if it's directed towards devices. Often, bullied individuals show signs of depression
                            and anxiety. Other emotional changes include sudden anger and lashing out.</li>

                            </strong> An individual might be jumpy and unwilling to speak to a friend, relative, partner
                            or colleague. This may be especially true when it comes to talking about social media.
                            Often, they fear how they will be viewed. Also, they might not want to create a more
                            complicated situation, especially with work & relationships.</li>

                            <p>Pay close attention to how social media and online content is influencing you. How does it make you feel?</p>
                            <p>Does reading the news make you feel informed or stressed?<br>Does seeing photos of your friends at a party make you feel good or envious?<br>
                            Do you check your phone first thing in the morning to learn about breaking news or out of pure habit?</p>
                            <p>Identifying why you are online and how it makes you feel can help you set the right personal limits.</p>

                            <p>Check the privacy settings on all your social media profiles. <br>Keep webcams covered when not in use. 
                                <br>Be careful when signing up to apps and services online - especially providing your full name, address or photo. 
                                If you are concerned about something you have seen or experienced online, you should report the incident on the platform in question 
                                <br>(remember to take a screenshot as a record) and look up safety helplines and mental health services in your country for more support.</p>

                                <p>You can help others too, by being mindful of their online experiences, recognizing the signs that a classmate, friend or even stranger, is not well or exhibiting signs of distress, and helping them get the support they need.</p>

                            <strong><h5>Choose kindness</h5></strong>
                            <p>Use social media for good, by sharing positive and supportive content and messages with your friends, family and colleagues.
                                <br>For example, you could reach out to let someone know you're thinking of them or add a positive comment on a post they shared.</p>
                                
                                <p>If you find yourself responding to a message or post with something negative, 
                                    pause and consider whether you could frame it in another way or have an in-person conversation instead. 
                                If you see or receive messages or content you consider to be bullying or abusive, you should block and report it.</p>

                                <p>Words matter and it's important to think carefully about what we share. We all have the power to be kind and make someone's day!</p>

                            <strong><h5>Stay present and connected IRL</h5></strong>
                            <p>The lines between the online and offline worlds can feel increasingly blurred, making it hard to live in the present moment and satisfy our innate need for human contact.</p>
                            <p>Do you ever find yourself interrupting what you are doing so you can post it on social media, or scrolling through your friend's stories rather than calling or meeting up to see how they are doing? <br>It's important to try and switch off and take a break from social media every now and then and spend time with friends and family in real life too, where it's safe to do so.</p>

                                <p>Try and set yourself realistic and personal goals, for example not picking up your phone or going online for the first hour of the day (it wastes energy and trains you to absorb information unfiltered) or just before bed.</p> 
                                <p>Activities such as meditation, going for a walk, or calling a friend will help provide a similar stimulation but leave you feeling more focused and relaxed.</p>
