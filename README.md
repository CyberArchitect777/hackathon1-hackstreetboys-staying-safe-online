## Introduction

Welcome to CyberSafe Haven, a website designed to introduce key concepts of staying safe online. The aim of this project is to clearly and concisely illustrate the best approaches and practices in dealing with important computer security issues. In addition to this, there are sections about security online as well as content on cyberbullying and general harrassment. Finally, there are links to further information for curious readers in the "More Information" page along with final credits for external content used.

This website was created during Hackathon 1 of the "16-Week High-Performance Full Stack Skills Bootcamp" which ranged from 06/04/2024 to 06/06/2024 (12pm). Permission was given by the Bootcamp lead to start coding on the day before and some minor ideas were explored during this time. Planning and preparation for the Hackathon was conducted over the weekend before (2024/06/01 - 2024/06/02). The requirements of this Hackathon is found [here](/assets/docs/hackathon-1-requirements.pdf).

## Development Considerations. 

Upon selection of our chosen topic, we began a process of consideration into how the project might be designed and development. An initial stage was considering what categories and content a sequence of pages might contain. After collecting some summarised information from ChatGPT, we collected an exhaustive amount of information before sorting out initial categories and information. The data we collected and sorted through is contained in [initial-categorisation.pdf](/assets/docs/initial-categorisation.pdf)

A project board was set up during GitHub Projects and populated with tasks. As the project progressed, these items were moved from "Todo" to "In Progress" and then to "Completed". A full Agile methodology was not required during this Hackathon and thus the project board was only used in a basic sense for management.

Wireframe ideas for the design were created to give a sense of the kind of interface we were going for. It was made clear during preparation for this Hackathon (being the first one) that most of the focus would be on the coding for the challenge and thus only limited attempts were made on wireframing concepts. A design was drawn up on mobile dimensions and then expanded to show tablet and laptop/desktop layouts. An example illustration of a themed website in colour was then created using this approach. Ultimately, the styled design was not retained although the wireframed black and white designs ended up laying the ground work.

An index.html page was created initially with focus on this as a template page. For this reason, the priority was on creating a header, nav bar and footer which was largely completed. Later on, it became clear that operational time limits meant that changes were required to the scope. At this point, a separate unlinked template.html file was created and used as a base for other pages allowing content to be easily added to index.html. From here, the site was expanded to other pages and populated with first content and then designed to a consistent, easy-to-read style.
