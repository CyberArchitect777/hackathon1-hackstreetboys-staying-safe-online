## Development Considerations. 

Upon selection of our chosen topic, we began a process of consideration into how the project might be designed and development. An initial stage was considering what categories and content a sequence of pages might contain. After collecting some summarised information from ChatGPT, we collected an exhaustive amount of information before sorting out initial categories and information. The data we collected and sorted through is contained in "assets/docs/initial-categorisation.pdf"
