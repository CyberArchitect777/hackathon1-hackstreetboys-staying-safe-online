                        <div class="col-md-6 mt-3">

                                Why it’s important to take special care of your email password.

                                We're often told that the passwords to access our online accounts should be really
                                strong, and not to use them anywhere else. This is especially true for the password for
                                your email account. If you've used the same password across different accounts, cyber
                                criminals only need one password to access all your accounts.

                                Always use a strong and separate password for your email; that is, a password that you
                                don’t use for any of your other accounts, either at home or at work.

                                If a criminal can access your email account, they could:

                                access private information about you (including your banking details)
                                post emails and messages pretending to be from you (and use this to trick other people)
                                reset all your other account passwords (and get access to all your other online
                                accounts)
                                Having a strong and separate password for your email means that if cyber criminals steal
                                the password for one of your less-important accounts, they can’t use it to access your
                                email account.</p>

                                The NCSC encourages people to use password managers, which can create strong passwords
                                for you (and remember them).

                                If you have re-used your email password across other accounts, change your email
                                password as soon as possible. It should be strong and different to all your other
                                accounts.

                                Ideally, you should use unique passwords for all your important online accounts (such as
                                banking accounts, shopping/payment accounts and social media accounts), not just your
                                email account. You should also provide additional protection by setting up 2-step
                                verification (2SV) on your email account, which will prevent a criminal from accessing
                                your email account even if they know your password.

                                criminals.

                                You should apply updates to your apps and your device's software as soon as they are
                                available. Updates include protection from viruses and other kinds of malware, and will
                                often include improvements and new features.

                                If you receive a prompt to update your device (or apps), don’t ignore it. Applying these
                                updates is one of the most important (and quickest) things you can do to keep yourself
                                safe online.

                                You should also turn on 'automatic updates' in your device's settings, if available.
                                This will mean you do not have to remember to apply updates.

                            <p>Turning on 2SV is one of the most effective ways to protect your online accounts from
                                cyber criminals.

                                You should protect your most important accounts (such as email, banking, social media
                                and online shopping) by making sure you have 2-step verification turned on for each of
                                them.

                                2-step verification (2SV), which is also known as two-factor authentication (2FA) or
                                multi-factor authentication (MFA), helps to keep cyber criminals out of your accounts,
                                even if they know your passwords. The NCSC recommend you take time to set up 2-step
                                verification on all your important accounts, even for ones that you've protected with
                                strong passwords.

                            <p>We're often told that the passwords for our online accounts should be really strong, and
                                to not use the same password anywhere else. Especially for those important accounts like
                                email, banking, shopping and social media.

                                The trouble is, most of us have lots of online accounts, so creating different passwords
                                for all of them (and remembering them) is hard.

                                This is where a password manager can help. A password manager (or a web browser) can
                                store all your passwords securely, so you don’t have to worry about remembering them.
                                This allows you to use unique, strong passwords for all your important accounts (rather
                                than using the same password for all of them, which you should never do).
